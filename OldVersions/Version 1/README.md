# Version 1 
Version 1 considers the car to follow random velocity profiles and trains a pedestrian model for it.
Trajectories are generated from this model. 
Behavioural cloning was applied to learn from the trajectories generated.
The model of the pedestrian was included in the env of the car to allow it to learn, this resulted in a stalmate
